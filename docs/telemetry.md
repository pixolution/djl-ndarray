# Usage Tracking

Since DJL 0.20.0, DJL collects telemetry to help us better understand our usersâ€™ needs
when running on AWS EC2. DJL contains code that allows DJL development team to collect the
AWS EC2 instance-type, instance-id and DJL version information. No other information about
the system is collected or retained.

To opt out of usage tracking for DJL, you can set the `OPT_OUT_TRACKING` environment variable:

```bash
export OPT_OUT_TRACKING=true
```

or Java System property:

```java
System.setProperty("OPT_OUT_TRACKING", "true")
```

Usage tracking is also disable in `offline` mode:

```java
System.setProperty("ai.djl.offline", "true")
```
